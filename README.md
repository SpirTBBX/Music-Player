# [ANY] Music Player

This plugin has a VipMenu for flag o (flag custom1).

# Requirements:
- Sourcemod 1.10 build 6502; (This was the version which the plugin was compiled and tested)

# Includes to compile:
- Sourcemod 1.10+ (I recommend compiling with the version that I used that is displayed above)
- SDK Tools
- ClientPrefs

# Installation:
- (If you are updating) -> Backup your musics config and check if nothing has changed or is needed to add to it.
- Drag all the files to their respective folder.
- Place all your sounds inside the folder 'sound/SpirT/'

# Music File Path Setup Ideas:
- Some people asked if the file must be inside 'sound/SpirT'. It isn't necessary, if you set the file path to 'DnB/music1.mp3' the file should be placed on 'sound/SpirT/DnB/music1.mp3'. With this example, you can have your files organized by category and it's easier to manage whose you want and don't want anymore.

# Commands:
- sm_music - Opens a menu where players are able to choose any music to play.
- sm_stop - Stops the current playing music.
- sm_playervol <volume> - Sets the volume that all the musics will be played with.
